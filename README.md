# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to extract specific Data Points from a dataset using filters and pivot tables in order to analyze different outcomes. Upon analyzing different outcomes we learned how to visualize it using graphs and charts and present it to Louise to point out patterns and trends under specific conditions. In terms of extracting the data, we learned the importance of formatting in order to make sure the date is clean and presentable and easier to filter and extract. We also learned how to utilize basic functions such as countifs and sum. This was all in order to help Louise have success in planning a campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
